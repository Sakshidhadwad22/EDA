# EDA
In machine learning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding and preparing data for modeling. The steps i mentioned are commonly used to clean and preprocess data during the EDA process. Here's a brief overview of each step:

Removing outliers: Outliers are data points that are significantly different from other data points in the dataset. Outliers can be caused by errors in data collection, measurement errors, or anomalies. Removing outliers can help improve the accuracy of models and reduce their sensitivity to unusual data points.

Removing unwanted columns: Unwanted columns are those that are irrelevant to the modeling task or contain redundant information. Removing these columns can reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve the performance of the model.

Encoding: Machine learning algorithms typically require that categorical variables be encoded as numerical values. There are various encoding methods available like one-hot encoding, label encoding, binary encoding and others that can be used to convert categorical variables to numerical values.

Skewness removal: Skewness is a measure of the symmetry of the distribution of the data. If the data is skewed, it can affect the performance of some models. Skewness can be reduced by transforming the data, such as using logarithmic or exponential functions.

Scaling: Scaling is a process of normalizing the data to have a similar scale. Scaling can improve the performance of some models, especially those that rely on distance-based measurements, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNN).

In summary, these steps are commonly used during EDA to clean and preprocess data before building machine learning models. However, it's important to note that the specific steps taken during EDA may vary depending on the nature of the data and the modeling task.
